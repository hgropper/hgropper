- 👋 Hi, I’m @hgropper

- 👀 I’m interested in anything that has to do with data science, and this is why:
Many people write excellent novels that tell the most exciting stories. 
Although I could be a better storyteller, I have the power of data science on my side. 
The more time goes on, the more data there is and the more interesting untold stories we can tell. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning.
Implementing many algorithms from scratch and understanding how they work.
For example, decision trees, gradient descent, autoencoders, and support vector machines.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is data science related!

- 📫 How to reach me: My email is hgropper25@gmail.com
