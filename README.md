- 👋 Hi, I’m Harrison Gropper, but you can call me Harry if you'd like to!

- 👀 I’m interested in anything that has to do with data science, and this is why:
Data is the best story teller.
As time passes, the more data there is and the more interesting stories we can tell. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning.
Implementing many algorithms from scratch and understanding how they work.
For example, decision trees, gradient descent, autoencoders, and support vector machines.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is data science related!

- 📫 How to reach me: My email is hgropper25@gmail.com
